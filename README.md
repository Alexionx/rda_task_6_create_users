# Creating Database Users

User and permission management is one of the most important database administration activities, and now it's time to master it! In this task, you will work with the `ShopDB` database for the online store. As the shop grows and prepares for the production release, you need to prepare the service database users. 

The database has the `Countries` table with the `ID` and `Name` columns. 

## Prerequisites

1. Install and configure a MySQL database server on a Virtual Machine and connect to it with the MySQL client.
2. Fork this repository.

## Requirements

Write SQL code, which creates database users and configures permissions for them:

1. Connect to your database server. 
2. Write a code that creates users and configures their permissions in the `task.sql` file. 

Create 2 users: 

1. `webappuser` (password: `P@ssw0rd`). It will be used by the web application and should be able to perform only basic CRUD operations in the `ShopDB` database (read data, create new records, update, and delete existing records).
2. `deploymentuser` (password: `P@ssw0rd`). It will be used by the automated deployment pipeline to create new tables in the database. The user should be able to perform all actions on the `ShopDB` database.

## How to Test Yourself

Just in case you want to test your script on your database before submitting a pull request, you can do it by performing the following actions: 

1. Run the database creation script (`create-database.sql`) on your database server. 
2. Run the script you wrote in the `task.sql` on your database server. Note that you will need to run the commands from the virtual machine, where the database server is installed, under the `root` user.   
3. Connect to your database with the `webappuser`, and check if you can perform CRUD operations on the `ShopDB` database (try to perform them on the `Countries` table). Try to create a new table â€”  you should get an error.  
4. Connect to your database with the `deploymentuser`, and check if you can perform CRUD operations on the `ShopDB` database (try to perform them on the `Countries` table). Try to create a new table in the  - you should get the table created without errors.
